# Forest-fire-intensity-prediction 
The purpose of this project is to predict the intensity of fires in Canada's wildlife according to the geographical coordinates of an area using supervised machine learning multi-classification algorithms.

For this project data is collected from NASA data (https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/download/), Viirs instruments, for the perid of 2021. 

In this repository you will find two notebooks for Exploratory data analysis(EDA) and modeling process. 

Below is the description of features in the dataset based on NASA website: https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-observation-data/near-real-time/firms/v1-vnp14imgt#ed-viirs-375m-attributes
